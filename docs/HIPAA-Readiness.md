# HIPAA Readiness Roadmap (Draft)

This app is **not** claiming HIPAA compliance. This document outlines a roadmap and placeholders to support a future HIPAA-aligned program.

## Scope (v0 Demo)
- On-device storage only
- No cloud sync or external transmission of PHI
- Offline-first data handling

## Future Roadmap (Non-Exhaustive)
- Formal risk analysis and HIPAA Security Rule mapping
- Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) for any cloud services
- Formal policies for access control, incident response, and retention
- Security testing (SAST/DAST, penetration testing)

## Current Gaps
- No formal compliance program
- No centralized authentication
- No cloud audit logging

## Next Steps
1. Define the compliance scope and owners.
2. Implement role-based access control and identity management.
3. Add encrypted storage and key management.
4. Build full audit logging with immutable storage.
